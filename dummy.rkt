#| Answer:
a) If we add coercing a type to itself, and call exp with two complex numbers (for which there
is no procedure, we will get an infinite loop with the current apply-generic. This is because
we won't find the procedure, and we will always have have a successful coercision, which
recursively calls apply-generic again.

b) Louis Reasoner is wrong that something needs to change about apply-generic. If we don't change apply-
generic currently, we will just get "No method for these types", which is true.

c) No alteration necessary
Altered apply-generic below:
