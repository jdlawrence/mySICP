#| This given code is a bit strange because the success code, (succeed 'ok fail2)
is in the alternative portion of the if. Therefore we need to write the logic
such that if the predicate is NOT true, we use the consequence portion of the "if"
statement. If the pred-value is false, then we use the first "fail", but if it's
true, we will used the passed in fail2.

(if (not (true? pred-value)) 
    (fail) 
    (succeed 'ok fail2))
